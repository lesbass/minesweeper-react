# Minesweeper React

This is a React (and a bit more modern) transposition of my 10 years old project made with jQuery (https://github.com/lesbass/minesweeper-jquery).
It has the same functionalities as the old version (no timer, no mines count).

Made for fun, to practice React JS and learn how to use Redux Toolkit.
